# Mechanicum Detachments

* All of these detachments have the Mechanicum faction.
* Magos and Magos on Abeyant are units with Officer of the Line (2)

## Sub-factions

* Mechanicum has sub-factions, but they work a little differently from Legiones Astartes sub-factions.
* In a Primary, Allied or Lord of War detachment, units do not have to have the same sub-faction.
* In an Apex or Auxiliary detachment, all units must have the same sub-faction.
* A unit added using Logistical Benefit does not have to have the same sub-faction as the detachment it is added to.
* Some units have a fixed sub-faction, but I'm not going to list them all.
