# Army Selection Rules

A description of how army selection works.

## Allegiance

* Every army has one allegiance from:
  * Loyalist
  * Traitor
* Some units have a fixed allegiance, and may only be taken in an army with that allegiance.
* For any unit without a fixed allegiance, the player chooses.
* Every unit in the army must have the same allegiance.

## Factions

The known factions in the game:

* Legiones Astartes
* Solar Auxilia
* Mechanicum
* Imperialis Militia
* Daemons of the Ruinstorm.
  * Daemons of the Ruinstorm units always have the Traitor allegiance.
* Cults Abominatio.
  * Cults Abominatio units always have the Traitor allegiance.
  * A detachment may never have the Cults Abominatio faction.
* Knights-Errant.
  * Knights-Errant units always have the Loyalist allegiance.
* Legio Custodes.
  * Legio Custodes units always have the Loyalist allegiance.
* Anathema Psykana.
  * Anathema Psykana units always have the Loyalist allegiance.
* Divisio Assassinorum.
  * Divisio Assassinorum units always have the Loyalist allegiance.
  * A detachment may never have the Divisio Assassinorum faction.
* Questoris Familia.
  * The Questoris Familia faction has additional rules that change how army selection works, when choosing it for the Primary Detachment, so skip that for now.
  * Questoris Familia units can be used in a different army in a Lord of War detachment.

Every detachment has one faction.
Every unit has one faction.
A unit may only be taken in a detachment with the same faction.

## Sub-Factions

Some factions are broken into sub-factions.
For detachment selection, treat the complete faction as the faction plus the sub-faction.
For unit selection, a unit without a sub-faction may be included in a detachment with the same faction and any sub-faction.

### Legiones Astartes Sub-Factions

* Emperor's Children
* Iron Warriors

* Blood Angels
* Iron Hands
* World Eaters
* Ultramarines

* Thousand Sons
* Sons of Horus
* Word Bearers
* Salamanders
* Raven Guard
* Alpha Legion
* Blackshields. The Blackshields sub-faction has additional rules that change how army selection works, so skip it for now.
* Shattered Legions

## Battlefield Roles

Every unit has one Battlefield Role.
Each detachment includes Slots, where each Slot has one Battlefield Role.
A unit may only be included in a Slot with the matching Battlefield Role.

Some Slots are Prime. If a unit is allocated to a Prime Slot, one of these rules can be used for that Slot:

* **Logistical Benefit**
  * No more than once per detachment.
  * An additional Slot can be added to the detachment.
  * The Slot can have any Battlefield Role, excluding High Command, Command, Warlord, Lord of War.
* **Special Assignment**
  * Only on a Command Slot.
  * A High Command unit may be allocated to this Command Slot.
  * This unit and Slot may not be used to unlock any other detachment.
* **Cult Operative**
  * Only in a Primary Detachment.
  * Only if the army has the Traitor allegiance.
  * No more than once per detachment.
  * Add a Support Slot to the detachment.
  * The Support Slot may only be allocated a unit with the Cults Abominatio faction.
* **Clade Operative**
  * Only in a Primary Detachment.
  * Only if the army has the Loyalist allegiance.
  * No more than once per detachment.
  * Add 3 Support Slots to the detachment.
  * These Support Slots may only be allocated units with the Divisio Assassinorum faction.

There are other Prime rules that are not detailed here, because they do not affect army selection.
A player might prefer to use one of those.

## Points Limit

* Points limit is a number, typically 3000.
* Players agree a points limit for their armies, and select units up to that limit.
* _This application does not deal with points values, but can give reminders of certain restrictions._

## Detachments

* Every army must include exactly one Primary Detachment.
* Some detachments have a fixed Faction (and possibly Sub-faction).
  These detachments can only be used if the Slot that was used to unlock the detachment has the same Faction.
  * _Faction specific detachments are detailed in separate files._
* Some detachments specify a certain unit.
  These detachments can only be used if that unit is allocated to the Slot that was used to unlock the detachment.
